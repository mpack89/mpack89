ðŸ‘‹ Hello

My name is Michael, I am a Software Development student at Get Coding. Im currently working on a website for a local Electrical contractor, Mahoney's Electrical.

As of now, i am working as a Journeyman Electrician and have been in the trade for the past 14 years. The last few years I have found the job to be monotonous and no longer challenging.
I have always had an interest in technology and find the field exciting and full of challenges, i've been studying Software Development with Get Coding and am excited to make it my new career.
